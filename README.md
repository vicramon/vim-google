## Vim-Google


Vim Google is a lightweight plugin that will open your browser and search Google for whatever you type in. 

### Usage

````
  :Google thing I want to search for
````

Also, for some added quickness just type `<leader>g` to get `:Google ` already typed for you. Then just type in your query and hit enter.
